== Support List of Trusted Beneficiaries Service

From now on, it's possible to create consent with trusted beneficiaries. In order to do it, one needs to update ASPSP
profile settings with flag `trustedBeneficiariesSupported` = `true` and send create dedicated consent request with
`trustedBeneficiaries` list inside `additionalInformation`. If `trustedBeneficiariesSupported` is `false`, list
`trustedBeneficiaries` in create consent request body will be ignored and not stored in database.

If detailed accounts are referenced, it is required in addition that any account addressed within the
additionalInformation attribute is also addressed by at least one of the attributes `accounts`, `transactions` or
`balances`. If this requirement is not met, one will get en error `400 SERVICE_INVALID`.

It's also possible to access `trustedBeneficiaries` from `CMS PSU API` and update it.
